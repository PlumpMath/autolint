Todo
====
* default config files for both jslint and jshint

* rename to drylint

* create plugin for js2-mode.el that sets global-externs

* a website

* being blamed for introducing an error, AND praised for fixing it,
  when changing around whitespace (changes line numbers)

* keep getting "nice cleanup!" in a file with too many errors

* files with more than 50 errors are reported as having 52 errors.

* switching git branches can be spammy, any way around that?
