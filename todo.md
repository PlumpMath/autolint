====
* being blamed for introducing an error, AND praised for fixing it,
  when changing around whitespace (changes lines)

* keep getting "nice cleanup!" in a file with too many errors

* files with more than 50 errors are reported as having 52 errors.

* replace `sys.puts(ansi.RED)` with dedicated object for printing

* licenses

* package with npm

* switching git branches can be spammy, any way around that?
