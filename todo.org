* Todo [0/8]
** TODO Dont bundle jslint or jshint, but fetch them with npm
   - requires some loading magic for jslint, since Crockford refuses
     to make jslint node-friendly.
** TODO look for changes in directories using some watch lib
** TODO create plugin for js2-mode.el that sets global-externs
** TODO use when.js instead of buster-promise
** TODO being blamed for introducing an error, AND praised for fixing it,
   when changing around whitespace (changes line numbers)
** TODO keep getting "nice cleanup!" in a file with too many errors
** TODO files with more than 50 errors are reported as having 52 errors.
** TODO switching git branches can be spammy, any way around that?
